//	Hermes is a robust error monitoring class as well as an SMTP interface
// Hermes focues on sending legitiment emails to warn you when your website
// has a fatal error or hits an execution branch that it shoudln't.
// A simple call to alert() will log the error and send an email
// with a dump of all variables decalred in the script when it was called.
//
// Dependencies:
// sendmail binary - sudo apt-get sendmail
// write access for log file. chown www-data hermes.log
//
// Example:
// $hermes = new Hermes("myErrorEmail@gmail.com");
// ...
// mysql_connect(..) or $hermes->alert(get_defined_vars(), __FILE__, __LINE__, FALSE);
// Where TRUE will kill execution and FALSE will not.  Default is true.
// This module was written with PHP5+ in mind
//
// Version 1.3.0 (5/25/12)
// 1 error per error per time period now working
// Spam filter bypassed on 5/27/12
//
// Planned improvements- 
// Error Page
// circular reference allowed? (unlikely)
